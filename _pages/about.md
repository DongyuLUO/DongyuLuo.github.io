<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the **The University of Hong Kong**, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree. I am fortunate to be conducting research at the Multisensory Machine Intelligence Lab at the **University of Maryland**, under the guidance of Ph.D. mentor [Kelin Yu](https://colinyu1.github.io/) and Prof. [Ruohan Gao](https://ruohangao.github.io/). I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dr. [Shixiang Tang](https://tangshixiang.github.io/) and Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) for introducing me to the world of research, especially during the early stages when I had no prior experience.

My research interests primarily focus on **multisensory intelligence** and **generative models**.

I am always excited to connect and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds. If youâ€™re interested in my work or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out via email!

<span style="color: red;">
I am currently seeking a Ph.D. opportunity for **Fall 2026** and would be grateful for any guidance or opportunity to grow and learn in the field.
